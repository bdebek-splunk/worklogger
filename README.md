# worklogger
WorkLogger tool to track time spent working on JIRA tasks and log the work

## Instructions:

The following environment variables must be exported:
```
- JIRA_API_URL
- JIRA_API_EMAIL
- JIRA_API_TOKEN
```

A common strategy is to create a .env file where the variables and corresponding values are defined.

Then:
```source .env```
